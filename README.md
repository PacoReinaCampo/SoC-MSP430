**Implementation in VHDL of a System on Chip compatible with MSP430 and simulation in GHDL**

A System on a Chip (SoC) is an integrated circuit that integrates components of a computer system (PU, RAM, GPIO, etc). As they are integrated on a single substrate, SoCs consume much less power and take up much less area than multi-chip designs with equivalent functionality. SoCs are common in the mobile computing, embedded systems and the Internet of Things.
